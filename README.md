Jay Eazy Ain't Drop Yet Bruh ‼️
Don't Worry Mega Man Drops Jan 7th ‼️
# Listen ‼️

I was never book smart, I'm money smart, makes me more intelligent  ‼️
Call me Mr. Rock festival, I got hella bands ‼️
Shorty cute, and her circle too, told her get a friend ‼️
She gon' make me slide with my dog like I'm Mega Man ‼️

For real, I do this 24, that's hella Mamba ‼️
What's the word, no teleprompter ‼️
Ever noticed? The ones that be like, "Wherе the hoes at?" nevеr got 'em ‼️
They never get a W and that's pretty much the L about 'em ‼️
With them, never reconciling ‼️
You gon' need biotics, you'll be sick of my shit ‼️
Like I'm reading comics, I got paper to flip ‼️
I don't walk on the beach for the men to acknowledge ‼️
I do it for shorties in lit colleges ‼️
Ain't nothin' better than throwin' my bait in the sea ‼️
Then tell Brodie that I got a fish ‼️
Reelin' on men every line ‼️
I hit 'em when you woulda thought that they had a sniff ‼️
Some shouldn't be allowed to rap, they go overheads like a shower cap ‼️
Shorties wanna take a flight for me, made pussy fly like a Owlcat ‼️
Hatin' on someone who get what they want 'cause you couldn't get it's a coward act ‼️
I really can't help the fact that I'm mean, look ‼️

I was never book smart, I'm money smart, makes me more intelligent ‼️
Call me Mr. Rock festival, I got hella bands ‼️
Shorty cute, and her circle too, told her get a friend ‼️
She gon' make me slide with my dog like I'm Mega Man ‼️

"I love you" is just eight letters ‼️
"Let's fuck" sound way better ‼️
She got cream on my BAPE sweater ‼️
I'm with the money team, Mayweather ‼️
Their limits are what they measure ‼️
Not my limits, that's Jay message ‼️
Hella bums dwellin' on the past, and I got a gift so I stay present ‼️
Me, and my nuts, that's a trifecta ‼️
When I let 'em hang, they slam on the floor like Brock Lesnar ‼️
How you gon' say, "Wait up for me, bro," and then not catch up? ‼️
That's like waiting for a dealership to show a Dodge Tesla ‼️
You don't got the stamina, and we know it now ‼️
Shorties waitin' for my badass, like it's Joey's crowd ‼️
If I'm up, why would I need someone to hold me down? ‼️
I only care if mama gon' be proud ‼️

I was never book smart, I'm money smart, makes me more intelligent ‼️
Call me Mr. Rock festival, I got hella bands ‼️
Shorty cute, and her circle too, told her get a friend ‼️
She gon' make me slide with my dog like I'm Mega Man ‼️
